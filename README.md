## Ess3D

#### About

Ess3D is a general purpose game engine written in C++. The rendering is done with OpenGL 3. 

The project initially started as a 2D game from which I've broken out a 2D engine that I'm now trying to refactor and develop into having 3D capabilities. The engine's main focus is efficient 3D rendering, GUI rendering, audio management, resource management and interpolated physics simulation (using a 3rd party lib).

I currently have no intention - and probably never will - of building an editor for this game engine, it's simply a C++ library that can be used in your project.

#### How to build

Nothing special to say, I've included all the dependencies needed. It should be as simple as opening the solution file in Visual Studio 2017, building and running.
