#### About

A 2D vertical scrolling fighter plane game implemented in C++. Rendering is done with OpenGL 3. I'm also writing a simple 2D engine which I'm hoping will power future 2D projects.

It's my first shot at proper game development from scratch. I've made a few games previously, but they were done with software rendering and they were at the basic level of Pong clones and such.
I hope to learn some bare basics in 2D and have a few complete projects before I move on to engines like Unreal or Unity and start doing some real 3D development.

I do this for educational purposes and, of course, for fun !

#### How to build

Nothing special to say, I've included all the dependencies needed. It should be as simple as opening the solution file in Visual Studio 2015, building and running.
